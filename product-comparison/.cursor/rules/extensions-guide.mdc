# Shopify Extensions Guide

## Overview
The [`extensions/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions) directory contains Shopify app extensions that extend the app's functionality into the Shopify storefront.

## Product Comparison Block Extension
The main extension is [`product-comparison-block/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block), structured as follows:

### Directory Structure
- [`blocks/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block/blocks): Contains Liquid block templates for the product comparison UI.
- [`snippets/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block/snippets): Contains reusable Liquid snippet files.
- [`assets/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block/assets): Contains static assets like images and client-side JavaScript.
- [`locales/`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block/locales): Contains localization files for multi-language support.

### Configuration
- [`shopify.extension.toml`](mdc:product-comparison/extensions/product-comparison-block/shopify.extension.toml): Configuration file for the extension that defines settings like name, type, capabilities, and permissions.

## Extension Development
- Extensions are bundled with the main app but run in the Shopify storefront context.
- Theme app extensions can add blocks and sections to themes.
- Extensions can use metafields defined through the app to store and display data.

## Deployment
- Extensions are deployed alongside the main app when using the Shopify CLI.
- The extension configuration in `shopify.extension.toml` determines how the extension appears in the Shopify admin.

## Related Files
- Product comparison logic in the app is implemented in:
  - [`api.product.comparison.track.tsx`](mdc:product-comparison/app/routes/api.product.comparison.track.tsx): Tracks product comparison events.
  - [`app._index.tsx`](mdc:product-comparison/app/routes/app._index.tsx): Main dashboard that may show product comparison analytics.
